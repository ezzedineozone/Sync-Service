#### TO COMPILE THIS APP YOURSELF, MAKE SURE THE #INCLUDE FOR THE SQLITE3 LIBRARY IS A VALID PATH TO A .H SQLITE3 FILE, IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REPOSITORY.
Same for the following dependencies:
asio
nlohmann json
#### DEFAULT PATHS THAT ARE HARD-CODED ARE:
-Sync Service/dependencies/sqlite3/(.H AND .C files go here)
-Sync Service/dependencies/asio/asio.hpp (with asio include)
-Sync Service/dependencies/json/json.hpp
